# Sea Battle Game

### Description

Welcome to my project. My goal was to recreate a popular board game. It was a school assignment. The game had to have only one source file and had to be compilable with GCC on any device. The user can choose whether he wants to play against another player or computer with some degree of artificial intelligence. Firstly, the user inputs board size, nick and places five ships of different size to the board. When the game starts, two players alternate turns until one of them has no active ship on board. When on turn, the player tries to guess coordinates of enemy vessels. Entire program was written using standard library of the C programming language.

### Technologies

Project is created with:
* C programming language: C11 standard
* only standard library of the C programming language

### Launch

Project includes SeaBattle.exe file executable on Windows platform. File does not edit, delete or create any other files and can be trusted, even if antivirus doesnâ€™t like it. In addition, main.c source code can be easily compiled with GCC compiler. All you need to do is run the .exe file, follow the instructions and enjoy the game.
